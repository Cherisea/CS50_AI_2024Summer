# Harvard CS50 AI
Inspired by Jeff Hawkins's resounding book on neuroscience and future of AI, I have decided to devote myself to this booming field in pursuit of an answer that has haunted me since I watched Terminator 1 as a kid -- will robots, equipped with a steel exterior that could withstand far more severa conditions than human bodies and powered by micro-processors that's more potent and precise than human brains, ever advance to such level of intelligence that they decide to eliminate humans so that they could be their own masters?

This course marks my first step towards that goal.
